Name: Willie Frank Rainey 3rd
Hometown: Atlanta GA

Prior IT Experience: 

I worked for a tech company a few years ago. the contract ended but I hAd fun. Whether in the warehouse Loading Laptops on the racks for imaging or onsite at a school installing, troubleshooting or removing/replacing devices, I enjoyed the problem solving and logistics of it all.

Outside of an actual job I am familiar with:
Structured cabling. cat5, pin outs, terminations. conduit bending
  Developer: Javascript, node.js, Express, React redux
              Python, Flask
  Networking: Familiar with IPv4, IPv6, Packet Tracer, CLI, subnetting

  
Career Plans: I would like to be flexible in my new career rule. I am currently doing freelance work for a nonprofit. they allow me to choose my task. I can go frintend, backend, devops, whatever you can handle. 
  I would like to work with servers because that's where all the data fir AI is.

Proud project: My most recent project is my favorate right now. I attended App Academy were I learned frontend and backend development. My personal project, theHype.com, I aim to make it a mobile app soon. I am enjoying developing it, adding elements and functionality as it grows, refactoring my code so it will either work better or just look better to me. I love ternary expressions in javascript, I just think it looks cool..

At least for me, new technologies and skillsets are truly learned when you can apply them to what you need or want to do. 
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
